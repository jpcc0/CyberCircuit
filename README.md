# Cyber Circuit

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cyber Circuit App repository! This app is designed to connect individuals to the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity/software/engineering. It features a sleek, user-friendly interface and provides valuable insights and updates on trends.

## Tech Stack

This project leverages a modern tech stack to provide a robust and scalable application:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with rich and engaging user experiences.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Node.js & Express**: Planned backend technology to handle server-side operations and data management. I have added this and now emails are being collected in the emails.json. I am contemplating using a third party for better data management/security.
